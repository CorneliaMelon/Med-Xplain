Med-Xplain is a patient-centric tool that leverages Generative AI to produce text-based medical summaries. This tool serves as a post-diagnostic aid with the primary goal of increasing patient awareness about their treatment options and improving clinician-patient conversations. It also acts as an intermediary interface between healthcare providers and patients, addressing the need for enhanced patient involvement in their care while alleviating the burden on clinicians.

**Key Features**

* Patient Information Tool: This application acts as an intermediate interface that bridges the gap between doctors and patients.

It can regularly update patients with relevant information and evolving treatment landscapes, helping them better understand their options as well as providing insights into ongoing medical research.
